My professor recommended this book.

>I read [Machine learning for Asset Managers](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/machine-learning-for-asset-managers/6D9211305EA2E425D33A9F38D0AE3545) and [Practical Time Series Analysis](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Time-Analysis-Prediction-Statistics/dp/1492041653) yesterday.

>Both were good in their own way.  The former is much more advanced and presents some ideas that you might not have been exposed to and the latter is much more intermediate but has hands-on examples, though the examples are a little simplistic and often with mediocre results.

It is quite good and covers a lot but it uses R and python interchangeably. I prefer python though.

I found this [coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/practical-time-series-analysis/home/welcome) and going to study it. This course uses R as well. Guess I need to learn and use R then. But I am planning to make a python version of notes for this course.


# Obsolete topics
\*_TS models and methods are poorly introduced in this book._

Mainly reference: "[Practical Time Series Analysis](https://clio.columbia.edu/catalog/13726036)" (2017) and its [github repo](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Practical-Time-Series-Analysis).
